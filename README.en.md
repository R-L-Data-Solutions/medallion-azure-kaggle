Medallion Architecture on Azure (From Zero to One)

This project implements a Medallion Architecture (Bronze â†’ Silver â†’ Gold) on Azure Databricks + Data Lake + ADF, using public data from Kaggle.

ðŸš€ Project Steps

Kaggle Connector

Using the Kaggle API to ingest a public dataset.

Script: scripts/kaggle_to_bronze.py.

Ingestion (Bronze)

Raw data stored in ADLS Gen2 under the bronze container.

Notebook: 01_bronze_ingestao_churn.

Transformation (Silver)

Data cleaning, normalization, and type handling.

Notebook: 02_silver_tratamento_churn.

Presentation (Gold)

Data prepared for analytics and BI consumption.

Notebook: 03_gold_apresentacao_churn.

Governance & Permissions

Setup of IAM, RBAC, and Unity Catalog.

Access control for schemas and external locations.

Quotas & Compute

Cluster errors and quota adjustments faced during execution.

Orchestration (ADF)

Azure Data Factory pipeline calling Databricks notebooks.

File: pipelines/adf_pipeline.json.

Traceability (Purview)

Cataloging and lineage for full end-to-end visibility.

âš¡ Key Learnings

Setting up roles and grants was crucial for enabling access.

Adjusting Azure compute quotas was necessary to avoid cluster failures.

Databricks â†” ADF integration brought real orchestration to the workflow.

Each permission/quota error was part of the practical learning journey.

ðŸ“Œ How to Reproduce

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/youruser/medallion-azure-kaggle.git


Configure the Kaggle API (~/.kaggle/kaggle.json).

Set up Azure environment variables (.env).

Run the scripts and notebooks in order: Bronze â†’ Silver â†’ Gold.

Import the ADF pipeline.
